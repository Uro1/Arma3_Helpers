# Arma 3 Helper Documentation

## Synopsis

This repository exists as an information dump along with help documentation.  
I see a lot of the same questions being asked and answered repetetively in the Arma 3 Community Discord server - <https://discord.gg/arma>

So I figured I will try where possible to create informative infographics and diagrams as PDF files for portability to explain some technical aspects of Arma/RV modding in laymans terms for ease of understanding.
